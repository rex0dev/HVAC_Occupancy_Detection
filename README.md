Occupancy prediction models represent an advancement, in managing building energy offering an approach to optimize energy usage. As the focus on 
sustainability and environmental conservation grows there is a recognition of the need to reduce buildings carbon footprint. By predicting occupancy 
levels these models enable building operators to adjust energy consumption based on demand reducing waste and cutting operational costs. Moreover by 
utilizing machine learning techniques these models can adapt to changing occupancy trends and environmental factors enhancing their effectiveness. 
Traditional methods of building energy management often rely on fixed schedules or manual adjustments, which struggle to respond to real time changes 
in occupancy and environmental conditions. This limitation can result in energy use. Compromised comfort for occupants. In contrast occupancy 
prediction models enable automated decision making based on data analysis allowing buildings to operate efficiently and intelligently. By drawing 
insights, from data and continuous monitoring these models can predict occupancy patterns and optimize heating, cooling and lighting systems 
accordingly to enhance comfort levels while reducing energy consumption. 
The implementation of occupancy prediction models requires an approach that includes collecting data preprocessing information, developing models 
and integrating them with building management systems. Gathering data involves placing sensors throughout the building to monitor occupancy, 
temperature, humidity and other important factors. Next data is processed to clean and organize it for analysis. Feature engineering is crucial, in extracting 
insights from the raw sensor data to create input variables for models. A range of machine learning algorithms including regression methods and advanced 
deep learning designs are used to develop prediction models for occupancy levels.
